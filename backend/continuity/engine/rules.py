"""The six rules. Written by hand, never generated — physics does not vary by project.

R1–R5 are electrical. R6 is sourcing, and it flows through the identical resolution
loop, which is the architectural claim: one loop handling a sold-out part and an
overheating regulator the same way.

Every rule is a pure function `Board -> list[Verdict]`. No I/O, no LLM, no clock. A
rule may only compare fields that were fetched, and every verdict it returns carries
the field name, its verbatim value and where that value came from.

A rule that *cannot* evaluate says `warn` and names the missing field. It never skips
quietly and it never substitutes a default — an unchecked constraint reported as a
pass is the one failure mode that would make the whole engine untrustworthy.

    is invisible to all three, and *silently* so: it appeared on the BOM with every check it
    did receive passing, and nothing said that the ones that matter most for a power part
    had never run.

    That silence is the fault this rule fixes. It cannot fix the coverage — checking a solar
    charge controller needs the panel's voltage, which needs a second externally-sourced rail
    that the model does not have. What it can do is refuse to let an unchecked part look
    like a checked one.
