"""Reading a distributor's raw strings well enough to choose what to look at.

## Why this exists alongside the normaliser

`normalize.py` turns a payload into a `PartSpec` with provenance, using a model, one call
per part. That is what *verdicts* are computed from and it is deliberately expensive: it
runs on the one candidate the engine is about to check.

This module does something different and much cheaper. It reads a value straight out of
the payload so the system can decide **which candidates are worth normalising at all**.

The distinction matters and it is the whole reason this is safe:

- Nothing here ever reaches a rule. A value parsed here selects and orders candidates;
  the engine still checks the normalised `PartSpec`, which carries provenance and was
  validated field by field.
- So a wrong parse costs a slightly worse candidate list, never a wrong verdict. That is
  a good place for a cheap heuristic, and a terrible place for one is anywhere downstream.

## Why the search API cannot do this instead

JLCPCB stores a whole range in a single string — `"Voltage - Supply": "4.5V~40V"` — and a
spec filter over it matches the range's **minimum**. Measured live:

    Voltage - Supply >= 48V   →  0 hits

because no buck has a *minimum* input above 48 V. So "must accept 48 V" is inexpressible
as a filter, and the same is true of every other "must be rated up to X" constraint. The
payload has the ceiling in it; it only needs splitting.

(Worth knowing: an unrecognised filter name is silently ignored by the server rather than
rejected, so inventing a parameter like `Voltage - Input (Max)` returns *unfiltered*
results and looks like it worked.)
