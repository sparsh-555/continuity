"""Record and replay distributor responses.

`CONTINUITY_FIXTURES=1` replays from `fixtures/` and never touches the network. Any
call without a recording is an error rather than a silent live fetch — a fixture run
that quietly reaches the internet is worse than no fixture mode at all, because it
looks offline right up until the wifi fails.

Otherwise calls go live and are recorded as they go, so a rehearsal produces the
fixtures the demo would replay.

This is the demo safety net, and it is disclosed in the pitch rather than hidden.
