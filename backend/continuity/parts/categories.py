"""What kind of part a slot wants, in a vocabulary the engine owns.

The peripheral equivalent of `Topology`. A regulator slot carries
`{topology: buck, vin_min: 48, vout: 3.3}` and returns six correct parts; the same slot
searched as plain text returns one screw terminal. Peripheral slots carried a string and
nothing else, and a distributor's free-text search is not a specification language.

Measured live, 10 Aug:

    'environmental sensor' → 0 results, so `search` fell back to its own first word
    'environmental'        → Circuit Protection / Fuseholders
                             Connectors / Female Headers
                             Hardware Fasteners / Metal Products SMT Copper Sheet

"Environmentally" matched RoHS marketing copy. Every one of those rows already carried
the distributor's own `category`, so nothing had to be fetched to know they were not
sensors — the slot simply had no way to say *I am a sensor, not a fuse clip*.

## Coarse on purpose, and filtered locally rather than pushed down

`jlc_search` takes `subcategory_name`, and it genuinely filters — ten of ten hits stayed
inside "Temperature Sensors" when it was set, and an unknown name comes back as a loud
`Subcategory not found` rather than being silently ignored the way an unknown spec filter
is. It is still the wrong lever here, for two reasons measured on the same probe:

- It matches *subcategories*, fuzzily. Passing the category "Sensors" resolved to
  "VOC Sensors" and returned four parts — a silent, arbitrary narrowing.
- Pinning a subcategory alongside the planner's text zeroes out. `'environmental'` inside
  "Temperature and Humidity Sensor" returns nothing, because no sensor says
  "environmental" either.

JLCPCB publishes no filter at the *category* level. So the constraint stays coarse, the
pool is fetched deep (`sourcing.DEEP_POOL`), and the wrong categories are dropped from
the results — which costs nothing, because every row already states its own.

## One name may satisfy several distributor categories

Current sensors are filed under `Magnetic Sensors`, not `Sensors`; motor drivers appear
under both `Motor Driver ICs` and `Power Management (PMIC)`. Both are observed in
recorded payloads. The mapping is one-to-many for exactly that reason, and it is checked
against the server's published list by a live test rather than against a memory of it.
