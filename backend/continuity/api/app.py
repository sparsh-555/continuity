"""FastAPI + SSE. Contract §1.

The frontend's only integration point. `useDesignSession.ts` swaps one line to point
at this, so everything here exists to make the wire behave exactly as the mock did.

## Why the event stream lives per thread and not in graph state

`seq` must never repeat, and LangGraph re-executes nodes on resume and on retry. A
counter kept in checkpointed state would rewind with the checkpoint and re-issue
numbers the client has already seen — which the client would then silently drop,
because it discards anything at or below its high-water mark.
