"""The wire format. `docs/specs/2026-08-02-contract.md` is authoritative for this file.

Every frame the frontend receives is built here, so that the contract has exactly one
implementation on the backend rather than one per node.

Two invariants the frontend depends on and will not tell you it is depending on:

- **`seq` is monotonic from 0, per thread.** The client drops anything out of order,
  and it initialises its high-water mark to -1 precisely so that `seq: 0` survives.
- **`edges` on `selection` and `conflict` are patches, merged by `id`.** Omitted fields
  keep their previous value. Sending a full replacement array works by accident until
  a field is left out.

    The counter lives here rather than in graph state because a node that retries —
    and LangGraph re-executes an interrupt node when it resumes — must not reuse a
    sequence number it has already sent.

    ## Why the counter is an int and not an `itertools.count`

    A count cannot be read without advancing it, and the number has to be *readable* for
    two reasons that only appear once threads outlive the process:

    - It must be persisted when a stream ends, because that is the moment a resume
      becomes possible.
    - It must be restored when one starts, because the client drops every frame at or
      below its high-water mark. A restarted counter therefore does not error, warn, or
      render — the resumed run is discarded in silence and looks like a hang.

    `-1` means nothing has been sent, which is deliberately the same value the client
    initialises its own high-water mark to, so that `seq: 0` survives.
