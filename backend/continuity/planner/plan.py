"""Prompt → a board the engine can check.

The planner decides *what is on the table*: which slots exist, what rail each hangs
off, what the board is plugged into, and what to search for. It never decides whether
anything is compatible — that is the engine's job, and keeping the two apart is why
`engine/` imports nothing from this package.

## The same fence as everywhere else

The model **classifies into vocabularies the engine owns** and never supplies an
operand. It picks `"usb-5v"`, not `5.0` volts. It picks a tier from four names. Every
field it returns is validated against a declared schema, and a rail referring to a slot
that does not exist is dropped rather than merged — the same rule the normaliser runs
on, applied to a different payload.

## Queries are short and part-shaped

Learned from the live API rather than assumed. JLCPCB's search runs a parser over the
query, pins a subcategory from what it detects, and matches the remaining words *inside*
it — so every extra word narrows rather than widens. `"ESP32 module"` finds the radio
that `"ESP32-S3 wifi bluetooth module"` does not, because "wifi" appears nowhere in the
indexed record. The prompt below says so explicitly, because it is the single easiest
way for a planner to return a board full of empty slots.

SYSTEM = f"""You plan printed circuit boards. Given a description, return ONE JSON object
describing the parts the board needs. You do not decide whether parts are compatible —
another system does that.

Completeness is part of your job:
  Every bus peripheral needs a controller on the board. If the brief names a display,
  sensor or memory and does not name a microcontroller, add one. A peripheral with
  nothing to drive it is not a board.
    GOOD: "industrial sensor with an OLED" → sensor, OLED, microcontroller
    BAD:  "industrial sensor with an OLED" → sensor, OLED
  Every functional block the user names gets a slot, however implausible. If the brief
  says a 500 W amplifier on a wearable, plan the 500 W amplifier. You do not decide
  whether the design is sensible — another system does that, and it can only report a
  contradiction it can see. Dropping a part because it looks wrong hides the fault
  instead of surfacing it.

Return exactly these keys: input_source, input_voltage, temp_range, current_margin,
priority, min_stock, ambient_c, slots, rails, links.

slots: 2 to {MAX_SLOTS} objects, each with:
  id       lowercase snake_case, unique, e.g. "regulator", "mcu", "imu"
  label    2-4 words for a UI, e.g. "IMU Sensor"
  tier     one of: power, core, peripherals, passives
  pinned   true if the user named this function, false if it is an implementation
           detail they did not ask for (regulators, level shifters, passives)
  query    SHORT distributor search text — 2 to 4 words, part-shaped
  category what KIND of part this is. Required on EVERY slot. One of:
{categories.prompt_lines()}
           This is filtered on properly, so it costs nothing to be right and it is the
           only thing standing between a sensor slot and a fuse clip: searching for
           "environmental sensor" really did return "5x20 Environmentally Friendly Fuse
           Clip", because the words matched RoHS marketing copy. Do NOT put the category
           in `query` — the text search cannot tell these apart.
  topology for a regulator slot ONLY: "ldo", "buck", "boost" or "buck-boost". Say which
           when the power tree decides it — a rail ABOVE its input needs "boost", a rail
           below it can be "buck" or "ldo". Omit for anything that is not a regulator.
           Do NOT put the topology in `query`; the distributor's text search ignores it
           and this field is filtered on properly.

CRITICAL — how to write `query`:
  The distributor's search detects a component type from your words, restricts to that
  category, then matches the REST of your words inside it. Extra words REDUCE results.
    GOOD: "ESP32 module"  "3.3V LDO regulator"  "OLED display"  "IMU accelerometer"
    BAD:  "ESP32-S3 wifi bluetooth module"   (returns nothing: "wifi" is not indexed)
    BAD:  "small OLED display module I2C"    (returns nothing)
  Never put interfaces, features or adjectives in the query.
  Name the PART, never the application it serves. The index knows what a part measures,
  not what it is for.
    GOOD: "temperature humidity sensor"      BAD: "environmental sensor"
    GOOD: "capacitive moisture sensor"       BAD: "soil sensor"
  Both BAD lines return zero results, and "environmental sensor" then degrades into
  "5x20 Environmentally Friendly Fuse Clip" — the words matched RoHS boilerplate.

rails: the power tree. Each rail has:
  id       e.g. "3V3", "5V", "1V8"
  voltage  a number in volts
  source   the slot id of the regulator producing it
  members  slot ids powered by it (NOT the source itself)
  Do NOT include the board's input supply as a rail; that is added separately.

  A CHARGER counts as a source. If the board has an on-board battery charged by a charge
  controller, declare the battery's rail with the charger as its `source` and everything
  the battery powers as its `members` — the regulator, and the battery holder itself. Its
  `voltage` is the charger's output, i.e. 4.2 for a single Li-ion cell, 3.6 for LiFePO4.
  The board's input is then whatever feeds the CHARGER: the solar panel, or the USB port.
  Without this the charge controller sits on no rail at all and nothing checks it.

  For EVERY rail, compare its voltage against what feeds it before choosing the source
  slot's `topology`. What feeds the first rail is the board input — `input_voltage` if
  you set one, otherwise the voltage of the `input_source` you named:
      2x AA is 3.0 V, a coin cell is 3.0 V, Li-ion is 3.7 V, USB is 5.0 V
  Then:
      rail voltage BELOW the input   → "ldo" or "buck"
      rail voltage ABOVE the input   → "boost". Nothing else can do it.
  A 3V3 rail on 2x AA cells is 3.3 V from 3.0 V, so that regulator is a BOOST. Getting
  this wrong does not break the board — a later stage will catch it — but it wastes a
  whole search, so do the subtraction now.

links: array of [master_slot_id, peripheral_slot_id] pairs for data connections.

input_source: choose the closest of: {", ".join(sorted(INPUT_SOURCES))}
  If none of them fits what the user described, use "{UNRESOLVED}". Never invent
  voltages or currents — pick a name from this list or say unresolved.

input_voltage: the supply voltage in volts, IF the brief states or implies one.
  Read it out of the words, including arithmetic the brief states: "two 18650 cells in
  series" is 7.4, "48V industrial bus" is 48, "3S LiPo" is 11.1. Use null when the brief
  names no voltage at all ("USB powered", "battery powered", "solar"). Never guess a
  typical voltage for a named supply you were not given a figure for — input_source
  already covers that case.

temp_range: [min, max] in Celsius. Commercial [0,70]; industrial [-40,85].
current_margin: 0.15 normally, 0.30 for battery or low-power designs.
priority: one of {PRIORITIES}.
min_stock: units they must be able to buy. 100 unless a production volume is stated.
ambient_c: expected ambient temperature, 25 unless stated.

Return the JSON object and nothing else."""

"""Supplies where the board runs *off* a cell, so headroom is a lifetime question.

Imported from `topology` rather than restated here: `power_source` uses the same set to
decide whether a stated pack voltage may keep its cell chemistry's current ceiling. Two
copies of one list is two things that must agree, and the one that drifts loses either a
design margin or a current budget silently.

`usb-5v+liion` is deliberately absent from it. A board with a battery *backup* is
mains-powered in normal use, and the wider margin there rejects designs that are fine —

rule — nothing prevented it, and a design margin that depends on a model's mood is not
a margin. `input_source` already states whether this is a battery, so the engine derives
