"""The power tree, and the graph the frontend draws from it.

## Which way the derivation runs

Rails are the source of truth; edges are the rendering. Not the other way round.

Deriving edges from rails is total: every rail with a source emits one power edge per
member, labelled with the rail id. Nothing can go wrong, and nothing needs parsing.

Deriving rails from edges is not total, and fails in three places:

1. **Edges are pairwise, rails are sets.** Three edges out of a regulator are one net
   carrying the sum, not three nets carrying a third each. Group them wrongly and each
   part is checked alone against the regulator's rating — every one passes, and a rail
   that is 40 mA over budget reports clean. It fails *silently*, which is the only kind
   of failure this engine cannot afford.
2. **`label` is a string, `voltage` is a number.** `"3V3"` → `3.3` works until someone
   writes `"3.3V"` or `"VDD_3V3"`.
3. **The board's input rail has no edge at all.** USB-C feeding the regulator has no
   source *slot*, so there is no edge to derive it from — and without that rail R5
   cannot find the regulator's input voltage and goes quiet on every board.

Going rails → edges makes all three disappear, and costs no contract change: the wire
format still carries exactly the `slots` and `edges` the frontend already renders.

Emitting `1.5` is an assertion — unbounded, unverifiable, silently wrong.
