"""The `seq` counter, and what has to survive a process restart.

`test_api.py` already checks that seq is monotonic within a run and continues across a
resume. Both of those hold because `STREAMS` keeps the counter in memory for the life of
the process — which is exactly the assumption persistence removes.

The client drops any frame at or below its high-water mark. So a stream that restarts its
numbering after a restart does not error, does not warn, and does not render: every frame
of the resumed run is discarded in silence and the run appears to hang. These tests pin
the two properties that make that impossible — a counter that can be *read* without being
consumed, and a stream that can be *started* from a number already issued.
